# Dahua Camera for Homey
Control your Dahua Camera's using Athom's Homey (this is NOT the official Dahua app).

## Thanks
Many thanks to robertklep, he helpt me a lot on the Athom forum. And also to Jorden Chamid, which I borrowed :) some code for e-mailing.

## Note
Please make sure when adding the camera you will add the username and password on the Device Icon. Otherwise it won't work as the App cannot authorize itself using the API. Adding a device is experimential. I hope this will work...

## Actions

- Go to preset position
- Create a snapshot (make sure you fill in the email settings)
- Zoom in/out (using a number from -100 till 100 you can zoom, I must say this is according the API Specs. But in my situation it fully zooms in or out)
- Reboot (reboot the device)
